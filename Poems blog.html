    <h2>Upon the Hour Glass
                        -by John Bunyan</h2>
    <p>This glass, when made, was, by the workman's skill,
        The sum of sixty minutes to fulfil.
        Time, more nor less, by it will out be spun,
        But just an hour, and then the glass is run.
        Man's life we will compare unto this glass,
The number of his months he cannot pass;
But when he has accomplished his day,
He, like a vapour, vanisheth away.</p>

    <h2>Clod of the Earth
-by Anna Hempstead Branch</h2>
    <p>Clod of the earth, that hardly knows
How the warm sun comes or the cold rain goes,
That lieth dumb and bleak and bare,
It was thy thought begat the rose.</p>

    <h2>The Dreamer
-by Madison Cawein</h2>
    <p>Even as a child he loved to thrid the bowers,
And mark the loafing sunlight's lazy laugh;
Or, on each season, spell the epitaph
Of its dead months repeated in their flowers;
Or list the music of the strolling showers,
Whose vagabond notes strummed through a twinkling staff,
Or read the day's delivered monograph
Through all the chapters of its d√¶dal hours.
Still with the same child-faith and child regard
He looks on Nature, hearing at her heart,
The Beautiful beat out the time and place,
Through which no lesson of this life is hard,
No struggle vain of science or of art,
That dies with failure written on its face.</p>
